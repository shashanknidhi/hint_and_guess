# hint_and_guess
Here in rhis hint_and_guess game project, I have used list and loops, using python
Player will get a hint at first to enter a guess.
If s/he's guess is right, it will display the congratulation message.
If s/he's guess is wrong, characters of input will be compared and based on it, it will display next hint consisting of correct characters you entered in previous guess.
Lastly , it will display how much guess you took to guess the correct one.

Now, this is game to be played on command line interface (CLI),
Future Work: GUI app (Desktop, web app or mobile app)
Open for contribution
